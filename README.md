# OmniPHP Framework
===================

## TEST (WIP (Work In Progress))
OmniPHP is a set of libraries and components for:
- HTML5 forms with all pertinent validations
- CRUD
- Database Abstraction Layers and ORM (Object Relational Mapping)
- jQuery, jQuery UI, and other AJAX libraries/plugins
- Session handling
- Report Building
- Security

My long-term purpose is to evolve OmniPHP into a full-stack framework and allow:
- An easy to pickup framework that allows developers to start working immediately on
  their web solutions (via OmniPHP) without having to go through a steep learning curve.
- Architectural Patterns: MVC (Push/Pull) and good-old procedural.
- Data: Active Records like, LINQ-like, Hibernate-like built-in ORM solutions
- Scaffolding for fast code generation
- Integration with major IDE's and development solutions
- Enterprise focus: flexibility, scalability, optimization, security
- Many, many, others.

NOTE: I will eventually do a production level release and I continually extend its functionality even when not 
doing actual releases. However at this very moment the project is in a "proof-of-concept" phase, therefore I 
exhort people who come here by accident now to please wait for a while and keep an eye out on the project, I promise
I will do my best to release a useful solution as soon as possible.

Current Development (NOT-FOR-RELEASE) Version:
